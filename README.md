🏡 House Price Prediction Model

A simple Machine Learning project built in Python to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location, and more. The model illustrates how regression techniques can be applied to make accurate predictions in real world scenarios.

📋 Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing housing details to train a predictive model that estimates house prices.
It covers essential steps of a typical ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical computations
matplotlib / seaborn – for data visualization
scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

🧠 Model Description

The model uses a Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices.
You can easily modify it to experiment with other algorithms such as:
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost

📈 Results

The model outputs:
Predicted house prices based on test data
Evaluation metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Visualization graphs show:
Relationship between features and target variable
Actual vs Predicted price comparison

🧩 Future Enhancements
Include more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
Web interface using Flask or Streamlit
